## Current Goals
+ Creation of stats and testing
+ stats and mods integration into equipment, abilities, roles, armor
+ refactor armor (partially done)
+ [#29][i29] Add logging (error, info, debug) | +0.0.1
+ *Details* method to classess, recursive call that will print the full details of items and change the __str__ to pad print friendly version for quick use
+ Change testing method to pytest instead of unittest

## Changes Made and Work Done

------------------------------

#### In Progress 
- Convert tests from unittest to pytest
- Stats object creation _0.4_
- TODO:
  - See stats class for sub class build out
  - Need to create in a way that so that if I want to add a new stat attribute that I do not have to change all of the code too much
  - May need to hard code, each sub class specific stats with the base class and define there

- __Integration__
  - Equipment - will use a basic stats object and have the ability to add/remove modifiers and return stats for being added to 
    - get_stat method
    - add mods
    - remove mods
  - Abilities - Abilities will have modifiers that will effect/added to a role stats
    - get modifiers/use method that will return the mod effect.
    - use of ability will apply the modifier
  - Roles
    - May just need a regular stats object that can be buffed
  - Character
    - Will need the whole shabang
  - Armor:
    - Not sure what this should get?
  
- [ ] Change armor __str__ function so that it is the current details and add equipment aggregation for full print out.

#### Added/Changed
- Added basic logging to all character modules
- created modifiers and stats class __0.4.7__
  - creating an abstract stats base class so that it is easily customizable by subclasses  
- base stat level up attribute

#### Fixed
- Reduced complexity of armor dequip function __0.4.8__

#### Informational
- Added pytest for testing
- Converted C++ code to Python

## Important Items

------------------------------
- Convert all code into Python, Codetests into unit testing, and getting local imports to work.
- [ ] CodeTest File Updates _06.25.2021_
  - All Code Test files need to be updated to the new versions before new methods can be made
    - creating python unittests for significant if not all functions
  - [x] Equipment __7.15.2021__
  - [x] Armor _7.16.2021_ __11.28.2021__
  - [x] Abilities _11.28.2021_ __1.8.2022__
  - [x] Roles __02.2022__
  - [x] <s>Functions</s>
  - [x] Stats _3.23.2022_
- [ ] Stats Integration _3.28.2022_

## TO DO's <!-- Update version number when changes made-->

Subject | Description | Created/Updated
:---:|:---|:---:|:---:
Logging | Need to set up logging for different information and events that happen in the game and save to a file for evaluation. This is partially implemented but the logs are logging the same thing so, need to find a better way to do this. | __In Progress__ | 04.19.2022
Types | Turn type constants into enums that way the the str or int value can be used | __To Do__ | 4.19.2022

utils.export | Create functions to export groups/sets of objects types for each class. Also test a full character export <ul><li>Equipment</li><li>armor</li><li>roles</li><li>character</li></ul> | __To Do__ | 10.04.2021
