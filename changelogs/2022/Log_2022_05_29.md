## Comments
- JE - 9.14.2022 - Have not spent time with the project and still working on managers
- JE - 9.18.2022 - Holding off on editing function as of right now
- JE - 9.21.2022 - May use the modifier manager as a PoC/Template for the others and will probably remove the id process, store document, direct access to management functions. Will limit to only creation for equipment as maybe abilities. It will be similar to stats or armor as it is more tied to the equipment it self and just needs the object created.
