--------Questions-------
? Should Armor have a type to only accept equipment of that type or should character have a armor type and validate equipment of items


\\Project
	- Added Run.bat to run the test files which will also capture 
    + Add and Inventory Class
		+- Not sure what type of storage it should but the goal is to get it to be a storage unit for adding and reading in equipment. I will want to sort it also, probably by item type.
============================================================================================
\\TEST Files
	- Files that will hold old tests
	- Should test every method atleast once
	+ Should Print Test Name and Test performing at the top?!
	+ Each should have it's own folder and a make file to be added to the Test folder make file and .exe needs to be added to CodeTest.bat
	+ Files to Make:
		+ CodeTest_Armor.cpp
		+ CodeTest_Roles.cpp
		+ CodeTest_Character.cpp
		+ CodeTest_Combat.cpp
		+ CodeTest_Functions.cpp
============================================================================================
\\Test.cpp
	!! 1/1/2019 -  Transfering old test to individual files
    - Make sure that whenever you create a 'new' that you have a 'delete' for it.
    - Changing to only test current work
    += Testing of Functions.cpp to read in Equipment and Roles;
        [+-] may have to change the way things are saved in exported list. Struggling to get code to parse the lines read in.
		+ Equipment Read In
		+ Roles Read In
	+ Finish testing the Armor class.
	+ Test removePowers in Roles
	+ remove old tests
============================================================================================
\\Equipment.h
	- Want to use states for defense and attack based on ability points	
	+ Describe/Condense the getItemType function
    + Add validation method for IT, WT, AT... ?
        - Should I do this here, upper level, or at all
    + Annotate Functions
============================================================================================
\\Roles.h
	+ Add a remove powers method - working on this
	+ Annotate Functions
============================================================================================
\\Armor.h
    - thinking about changing the name of stats and print for Armor class to brief and stats
	- I did not like the way that Stats and Print look, either need a full or just a brief so I want to change the format of this somehow (back burner)
	+ Change function, I'm not sure if i really need it considering i have the equip and unequip, but might use it to properly change items for the slots considering how memory is 		transfered or linked from one place to the other. [Work in Progress]
	+ Annotate methods
============================================================================================
\\Character.h
	-Keep working on this one, I know that I am tweeking the other classes that also work with this one, if I add the inventory class I might add a small sized one to this one called 		bag that is a mini inventory object.
	+ Annotate methods
============================================================================================
\\Functions.cpp and Functions.h
	- Added Linked List to hold all types of things
	[+] Fix printToFile(Equipment) method for because the method does not 
	+ Finish readRoles(Classes) method
		+ Print Classes to file first then,
		+ Useu file for Classes to be read 
    + Annotate methods
============================================================================================
\\Makefiles
	+- Makefile for each Test
	+- Makefile for Test folder which will compile all subfolder files
============================================================================================
\\BatFiles
	Run.bat - runs the current test code in probably
	CodeTest.bat - goal is to run all of the code Test and produce results files for each of them
