\\File
- Note
+ To DO's
!! Reminders/Important
? Questions

!! Reformat the way that these notes are done

Current Directories = 15
Current Files = 75

Changes Made and Work Done
--------------------------
- Figured out that CodeTests.bat is not really going to work, and needs to be reworked, because when the individual folders run is called, it does not return back to the main bat file. So will work on.
- Also figured out that the make files for making all of the CodesTest is not working either will probs need to be done in another way,
and I have removed the call from the function.

Action Items
----------------
+ Test equipment validation method
+ Armor Test needs to be made
+ Work on Character.h
+ Turn Logs into Markdown files

!!!!!!!!!!TO DOs!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!! - Having issues with pointers if object is deleted its is deleted from everywhere, need to find a way to copy a pointer.

\\Test.cpp
	+ Fix Test.cpp File, is not printing out everything stops before the dequip, issue might be with the Equipment Array Weps....
        - Worked on Test File, found errors with printing armor that were causing the issue. Still in progress.

\\Armor.h
    + Test File for Armor
    +! Having issues with change function, need to try new test to see what wrong
    +!- thinking about changing the name of stats and print for Armor class to brief and stats - 1/1/2018
	+!- I did not like the way that Stats and Print look, either need a full or just a brief so I want to

\\Roles.h
	- Create dataset of roles {mage, warrior, thieft/rouge, healer}
	- Give a set of powers for each role
	- Create Read from file function

--------Questions-------
? Should Armor have a type to only accept equipment of that type or should character have a armor type and validate equipment of items


\\Project
	- Added Run.bat to run the test files which will also capture 
    + Add an Inventory Class
		+- Not sure what type of storage it should but the goal is to get it to be a storage unit for adding and reading in equipment. I will want to sort it also, probably by item type.
============================================================================================
\\TEST Files
	- Files that will hold old tests
	- Should test every method atleast once
	-! If a new method is introduced to object/class/file should be added/included in test files
	+ Should Print Test Name and Test performing at the top?!
	+ Each should have it's own folder and a make file to be added to the Test folder make file and .exe needs to be added to CodeTest.bat
	+ Files to Make:
		+ CodeTest_Armor.cpp - Need to Start
		+ CodeTest_Character.cpp
		+ CodeTest_Combat.cpp
		+ CodeTest_Functions.cpp
============================================================================================
\\Test.cpp
	!! 1/1/2019 -  Transfering old test to individual files
    - Make sure that whenever you create a 'new' that you have a 'delete' for it.
    - Changing to only test current work
    += Testing of Functions.cpp to read in Equipment and Roles;
		+ Roles Read In
	+ Finish testing the Armor class.
	+ remove old tests
============================================================================================
\\Equipment.h
	+ Need to test new validation method
		-> and 
	+ add -1 null value to AT, IT, WT,
		+ Change AT 0 -> no armor needed so that it will have 0 -> 3 and -1 will be a null value.
	- Want to use states for defense and attack based on ability pointe
	- Validation of IT, WT, and AT can also be done if inputed at a higher level, might consider adding null value -1 to all types to indicate null
============================================================================================
\\Roles.h
	- Ability Pointes can not be changed like a static object, have to find a way to fix this, may need an edit option.
	+ Add a remove powers method - working on this
	+ Finish printToFile method
	+ Annotate Functions
	+ Create a List of preexisiting/basic character roles [Data sets]
============================================================================================
\\Armor.h
    + Adding slot checks to dequip method because it fails if slot is empty.
    + isFull method needs more too it, some tweaking - 1/31/2019
    +!- thinking about changing the name of stats and print for Armor class to brief and stats - 1/1/2018
	+!- I did not like the way that Stats and Print look, either need a full or just a brief so I want to change the format of this somehow (back burner) - 1/1/2018
	+! Having issues with change function, need to try new test to see what wrong
    + Change function, I'm not sure if i really need it considering i have the equip and unequip, but might use it to properly change items for the slots considering how memory is transfered or linked from one place to the other. [Work in Progress]
	+ Annotate methods
============================================================================================
\\Character.h
	-Keep working on this one, I know that I am tweeking the other classes that also work with this one, if I add the inventory class I might add a small sized one to this one called 		bag that is a mini inventory object.
	+ Annotate methods
============================================================================================
\\Functions.cpp and Functions.h
	-? Added Linked List to hold all types of things?
	+ Finish readRoles(Classes) method
		+ Print Classes to file first then,
		+ Useu file for Classes to be read 
    + Annotate methods
============================================================================================
\\Makefiles
	- Makefile for each Test
	- Makefile for Test folder which will compile all subfolder files
		- Fix issues with not compiling of test values - 2/2/2020
============================================================================================
\\BatFiles
	Run.bat - runs the current test code
	CodeTest.bat - goal is to run all of the code Test and produce results files for each of them
