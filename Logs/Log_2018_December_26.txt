\\File
- Note
+ To DO's
!! Reminders/Important

\\Project
	+ Add and Inventory Class
		- Not sure what type of storage it should but the goal is to get it to be a storage unit for adding and reading in equipment. I will want to sort it also, probably by item type.
============================================================================================
\\TEST Files
	- Files that will hold old tests
	- Should test every method atleast once
	+ Files to Make:
		+ CodeTest_Armor.cpp
		+ CodeTest_Roles.cpp
		+ CodeTest_Character.cpp
		+ CodeTest_Combat.cpp
		+ CodeTest_Functions.cpp
============================================================================================
\\Test.cpp
	+ Annotate Functions
	+ Finish testing the Armor class.
	+ Test removePowers in Roles
	+ remove old test
	- Changing to only test current work
	- 1/1/2019 -  Transfering old test to individual files
	!! Make sure that whenever you create a 'new' that you have a 'delete' for it.
============================================================================================
\\Equipment.h
	+ Annotate Functions
	+ Describe/Condense the getItemType function
    + Add validation method for IT, WT, AT... ?
        - Should I do this here, upper level, or at all
	- Want to use states for defense and attack based on ability points	
============================================================================================
\\Roles.h
	+ Add a remove powers method - working on this
	+ Annotate Functions
============================================================================================
\\Armor.h
	+ Annotate Functions
	+- I did not like the way that Stats and Print look, either need a full or just a brief so I want to change the format of this somehow
	+ Change function, I'm not sure if i really need it considering i have the equip and unequip, but might use it to properly change items for the slots considering how memory is 		transfered or linked from one place to the other. [Work in Progress]
	- thinking about changing the name of stats and print for Armor class to brief and stats
============================================================================================
\\Character.h
	-Keep working on this one, I know that I am tweeking the other classes that also work with this one, if I add the inventory class I might add a small sized one to this one called 		bag that is a mini inventory object.
	+ Annotate functions
============================================================================================
\\Functions.cpp and Functions.h
	+ Fix printToFile(Equipment) method for because the method does not 
	+ Added Linked List to hold all types of things
	+ Finish readRoles(Classes) method
		+ Create text file for Classes to be read classes
