## GOALS

- Conversion from C++ to Python
- Working Game by 2021
- Have Character Class Ready for August 2020 or by the end of
- Create a print/text version of the game first for version 1

## Changes Made and Work Done

------------------------------

### 07.19.2021

- Removed old Data folder files
- Updated testing script to include flake8 to conform to python readability standard
- Update equipment test to remove the test file that is created during its run

## Important Items

------------------------------

- Convert all code into Python, Codetests into unit testing, and getting local imports to work.
- [ ] CodeTest File Updates _06.25.2021_
