## GOALS

- Working Game by 2021
- Have Character Class Ready for August 2020 or by the end of
- Create a print/text version of the game first for version 1
- Create a text image version of the game that moves for version 2

## Changes Made and Work Done

------------------------------

- Updated stats print out to be "< stats >" and tested it __<5.28.2021>__ 
  - Version: +0.0.1 -> 0.9.1
- Changing tasks to table entries
- Updating CodeTests md logs to simply information __5.30.2021__

## Important Items

------------------------------

- [ ] Armor Class: printToFile _7.3.2020_
  - Create new code test for testing printToFile Function, determine format for how this should be
  Look at other format to determine. Make sure it is able to print the stats out properly
- [ ] Stats Integration _6.26.2020_
- [ ] Test Logs __SEE BELOW__ _7.3.2020_
- [ ] Work on Character.h _2.17.2020_
- [ ] Reorder ToDos into a table

## Questions

------------------------------

- Should Armor have a type to only accept equipment of that type or should character have a armor type and validate equipment of items?
  - Answer: When the user gets a role they will grab the armor type needed for the role and then validate armor equips. __<3.21.2020>__
- How should a player/store inventory be done (Linked List/Array/RBDB)?
- Need to figure out how to fix makefile for this case _6.26.2020_  
  - Figured out that CodeTests.bat is not really going to work, and needs to be reworked, because when the individual folders run is called, it does not return back to the main bat file. So will work on.
  - Also figured out that the make files for making all of the CodesTest is not working either will probs need to be done in another way, and I have removed the call from the function.
